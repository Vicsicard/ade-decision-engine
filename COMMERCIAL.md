# Commercial Use of DDR (Deterministic Decision Runtime)

This document clarifies what constitutes commercial use of DDR and how to obtain appropriate licensing.

## What Is Commercial Use?

Commercial use includes any of the following:

- **Production Deployment** - Running DDR in any system that serves end users, customers, or generates revenue
- **SaaS Offering** - Offering DDR functionality as part of a hosted service
- **Embedded Distribution** - Including DDR in a product or platform you sell or license
- **Consulting Services** - Deploying DDR for clients as part of paid engagements
- **Internal Production** - Using DDR in internal business-critical systems that support revenue-generating operations

## What Is NOT Commercial Use?

The following uses are permitted without a commercial license:

- **Internal Evaluation** - Testing DDR to determine if it meets your needs
- **Development and Staging** - Using DDR in non-production environments
- **Academic Research** - Using DDR for research, teaching, or coursework
- **Personal Projects** - Non-commercial personal use
- **Contributing** - Submitting improvements back to the project

## Why This Model?

DDR is infrastructure for governed AI decision-making. It is designed for environments where:

- Decisions must be explainable
- Replay must be exact
- Authority must be bounded
- Compliance is non-negotiable

This licensing model ensures that DDR deployments are intentional, reviewed, and properly supported. It is not a restriction on access - it is a commitment to quality.

## How to Request a Commercial License

If your use case requires a commercial license:

1. **Contact us** at vic@getdigdev.com
2. **Describe your use case** - We will evaluate fit and scope
3. **Receive a proposal** - Licensing terms are based on deployment context, not seat counts

- Support requirements
- Alignment with DDR principles
